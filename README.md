# Working with Android Palette
With the release of Android Lollipop, several new support libraries have been created. One of the new libraries is for the [Palette](https://developer.android.com/training/material/palette-colors.html) class. This new class makes it easy to extract prominent colors from bitmap images, which is useful if you want to style other view components to match colors from your image, such as a background for the image or a text color with suitable contrast. One way I like to use this is to color the ripple drawable behind the image. It is a subtle effect, but I think it is a nice improvement over the standard grey.

For example, you can use a palette to create a color-coordinated title card for a song based on its album cover or to adjust an app’s toolbar color when its background image changes.
